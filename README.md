# Sort Manager project
This is an individual project done by myself while undergoing Java development training at Sparta global.
---
## Overview information of the project
When run, this project takes an int as the size of the array and provides user with two options of sorting algorithm. These are:

-[*bubble*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) Sort algorithm

-[*Merge*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_algorithm) Sort algorithm

Once user has entered the correct parameters, the program sort the array and prints our the sorted array with the time taken to sort the array in milliseconds. 

I implemented [Model–view–controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) software design patter as well as basic of object-oriented design to produce this program.

To run the program please, run the main class in start com.sparta.usama.start package.
